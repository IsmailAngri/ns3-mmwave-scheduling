# Author: ANGRI Ismail <ismail.angri@gmail.com>
# This reposity all the necessary files to simulate the scheduling algorithms in a 5G model
# Using "mmwave model" of the NS-3 simulator
# -----Folders----------
# Folder 1_Scheduling algorithms: It contains 09 scheduling schemes (03 already existing in the mmwave model, and 06 new developped algorithms)
# Folder 2_mmwave-epc-tdma: it contains the new version of the mmwave-epc-tdma.cc file, that contains the new model of our simulation
# Folder 3_Python Programs: It contains the Python programs used to extract the information (Throughput, SINR and delay) from the generated files
